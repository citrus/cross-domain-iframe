Cross Domain Iframe Communication: 
=====================================================

Insert block-level markup via dynamically sized iframes.

This example embeds a resource fetched from another server. This is enough to 
trigger cross-domain security restrictions and demonstrate the communication 
method: dom message and polling


Quickstart
==========

1) launch the server

  ./static.py

This will launch two web servers on your local interface, each running ports 
8888 and 8889 respectively. In order to kill the `./static.py` process, you'll
have to send it something like a SIGTERM (ctrl-|) or SIGKILL. 

2) Browse to http://localhost:8888/index.html

This will load content from the "foreign" server and display it in an iframe. 
The iframe will resize itself to fit the dynamic content.

Note: this method depends on the 'foreign' html content to consist entirely of
block level elements. So any <span>s and <p> tags must be wrapped in blocks.
