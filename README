=====================================================
Cross Domain Iframe Communication: 
=====================================================

A simple set of codes gathered from around the web to have some cross-domain
communication through iframes!

The basic idea is to include some media seemlessly from another foreign 
location, possibly another domain

The example given here is to embed a resource derived from another port. The 
is enough to trigger cross-domain security restrictions and demonstrate the 
communication method: dom message and polling


Quickstart
==========

1) launch the server

  ./static.py

This will launch two web servers on your local interface, each running ports 
8888 and 8889 respectively. In order to kill the `./static.py` process, you'll
have to send it something like a SIGTERM (ctrl-|) or SIGKILL. 

2) Browse to http://localhost:8888/local_document.html

This will load an iframe from the "foreign" port 8889 server and display the
resize the iframe viewport based on content size. 

Note: this method depends on the 'foreign' html content to consist entirely of
block level elements. So any <span>s and <p> tags must be wrapped in blocks.
